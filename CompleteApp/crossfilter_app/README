A Hack based on a flash of thouhgt:

The Crossfilter folder is actually all that is needed for the data visualization page of the website

1. chnage working main.py to old_main.py

2. copy contents of crossfilter to root crossfilter_app folder. 

3. change models.py to main.py and run the app and see what happends! ! 

Test in python3
