The package now contains

- benchmark-db models for the DB
- data - all the data in .csv format and a python script to test the api POST query 
         and file push
- benchmark-api* flask app which exposes the DB at various endpoints corresponding
                to the models in the DB
- benchmark-precision library of python functions for manipulations
- crossfilter_app*! - the working main page bokeh app for now
- prec_analysis*! - under dev bokeh app for plotting visualizations 
                     - pade function with R interaction for fitting
- accuracy_correlation*! - TO DO: a machine learning app that finds correlations in accuracies 
                        between different properties. 

* - will be served by Nginx 
! - are linked to each other by hyperlinks on the respective webpages 

NOTE: Copy the eos.py module to the ase root installation in the miniconda environment

Also install the package benchmark-precision now with python setup.py install

Developer's Notes:

To create a new app which has a new model:
  - edit query_api.py and benchdb.models.row_model.py in concert and test
    the new api endpoint with test_api.py located in benchmark-api
  - after testing with a mongo shell and the test_api.py, do a python setup.py install
    for benchdb
  - create a new bokeh app folder, you can use prec_analysis as an example
  - if new python/R analysis tools are required edit precisions.py and other
    *.py scripts in benchmark-precision. Do a python setup.py install for benchmark-precision
